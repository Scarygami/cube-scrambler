Rubik's Cube Scrambler
======================

> Want a scramble? Say `scramble` on your CLI!

NPM module that can be used from the CLI as well as other NPM modules to
generate Rubik's Cube scrambles.

# Getting started
```
npm install --save cube-scrambler
```

```javascript
import cubeScrambler from 'cube-scrambler';

cubeScrambler.scramble();
// ["U", "D2", "L'", ...]
```

Huge thanks to @jnrbsn who has written the core code for this
module. Find the original repository here: [jnrbsn/rubiks-cube-scrambler](https://github.com/jnrbsn/rubiks-cube-scrambler).

(I am just the guy who packaged it into a module!)
